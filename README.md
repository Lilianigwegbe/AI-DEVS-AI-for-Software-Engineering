##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Lilianigwegbe/AI-DEVS-AI-for-Software-Engineering.git

2. Navigate into the project:

cd AI-DEVS-AI-for-Software-Engineering

3. Ensure you have Python and the following libaries- pandas and scikit-learn installed.

4. Create a folder. In that folder, create a file 'diagnosis_randomforest.py'.Place your data.csv file in the same folder.

5. Open a terminal in that folder and run:
python diagnosis_randomforest.py
