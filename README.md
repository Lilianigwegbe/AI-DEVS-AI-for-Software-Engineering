# AI in Software Engineering – Week 4 Assignment  
**Theme:** Building Intelligent Software Solutions  
---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of AI in software engineering by combining theoretical insights, practical implementation, and ethical analysis. The assignment explores how tools like GitHub Copilot, Testim.io, and machine learning frameworks can be used to enhance coding, testing, deployment, and fairness in intelligent software systems.

##  Project Breakdown

### Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
- **Q1:** AI code generation efficiency & limitations
- **Q2:** Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning for bug detection
- **Q3:** Importance of bias mitigation in AI UX personalization
- **Case Study:** AIOps and automated deployment pipelines

###  Part 2: Practical Implementation

| Task | Description | Tool |
|------|-------------|------|
| Task 1 | Code completion comparison (Copilot vs. manual) | GitHub Copilot |
| Task 2 | Automated login testing | Testim.io / Selenium |
| Task 3 | Predictive model for issue priority | Google Colab, Scikit-learn |

### Part 3: Ethical Reflection
Discussion on dataset bias, fairness, and tools like IBM AI Fairness 360.

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Lilianigwegbe/AI-DEVS-AI-for-Software-Engineering.git

2. Navigate into the project:

cd AI-DEVS-AI-for-Software-Engineering

3. Ensure you have Python and the following libaries- pandas and scikit-learn installed.

4. Create a folder. In that folder, create a file 'diagnosis_randomforest.py'.Place your data.csv file in the same folder.

5. Open a terminal in that folder and run:
python diagnosis_randomforest.py
