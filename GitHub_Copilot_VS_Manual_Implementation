Task: Sort a List of Dictionaries by a Specific Key
Given a list belowe:

data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]
The goal is to sort it by the "age" key.

Comparison & Analysis
Both functions sort a list of dictionaries based on a specified key, but the AI-suggested version is cleaner, faster, and more Pythonic. It uses Python’s built-in sorted() function, which is optimized under the hood and much easier to read.
The manual version works, but it uses a basic insertion sort approach — it loops through and inserts each item into the right position. While it's a good learning exercise, it’s not efficient for large datasets. It’s also longer and more prone to bugs.
In short, the AI-suggested version is better for real-world use because it’s shorter, easier to understand, and performs better. Using tools like GitHub Copilot can save time on common tasks like this and help you write cleaner code faster.
