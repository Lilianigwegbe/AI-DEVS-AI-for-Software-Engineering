## ðŸ§ª AI-Powered Selenium IDE Test Summary

Using Selenium IDE with AI-powered visual validation from Applitools Eyes, we automated login testing for both valid and invalid credentials. The tests recorded user inputs, login button clicks, and result assertions. With valid credentials (`student`/`Password123`), the system redirected correctly. When invalid credentials were used, the test detected the expected error message. 

AI plugins like Applitools Eyes improved our test coverage by detecting subtle visual issues such as layout shifts, missing elements, or unexpected UI changesâ€”something traditional scripts often miss. Compared to manual testing, this method is faster, reduces human error, and maintains more consistent results across devices and browsers. Furthermore, AI can automatically adapt to small changes in UI (like button location) using smart locators, minimizing test breakage.

These features make AI-powered automation a powerful solution for scaling and maintaining quality assurance in modern software projects.
